title: Representation Learning
summary: Representation learning is a set of techniques that allows a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data.
description: Instead of manually designing features, it uses machine learning to transform complex data into a dense vector space (embeddings). This process captures the essential patterns and semantic meanings, making it easier for models to perform downstream tasks like recognition or prediction.
